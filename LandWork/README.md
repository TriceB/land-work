# Land Work - Beginner Python Student Challenge

Here's your assignment. Let's say that you have a client who is looking to buy some land in Arizona. They'd like to spend no more than $20,000 and they want the plot to be at least 1 acre.

The client wants a list of 10 plots of land that includes the street address, city, state, zip, the asking price of the plot and the number of acres. 

They would also like you to sort this list in two different ways. First, they'd like to see the list sorted from the largest plot to the smallest based on the acreage. Secondly, they would like to have the list sorted from the cheapest to the most expensive. 

Lastly, they figured it would be helpful to know the average price per acre for each plot.

## Land info

To grab the land info, here's a link from Zillow. You can use data from any 10 pieces of land. The client's parameters are already in place: https://www.zillow.com/az/land/?searchQueryState=%7B%22usersSearchTerm%22%3A%22Arizona%22%2C%22mapBounds%22%3A%7B%22west%22%3A-115.82555932031251%2C%22east%22%3A-108.24499291406251%2C%22south%22%3A30.882968828620363%2C%22north%22%3A37.06357192381545%7D%2C%22isMapVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22filterState%22%3A%7B%22ah%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22sf%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22manu%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22con%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22mf%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22apa%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22tow%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22price%22%3A%7B%22max%22%3A20000%7D%2C%22mp%22%3A%7B%22max%22%3A66%7D%2C%22lot%22%3A%7B%22min%22%3A871200%7D%7D%2C%22isListVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22mapZoom%22%3A7%2C%22regionSelection%22%3A%5B%7B%22regionId%22%3A8%2C%22regionType%22%3A2%7D%5D%2C%22schoolId%22%3Anull%2C%22pagination%22%3A%7B%7D%7D

## Tips

Each plot of land should be represented as a dictionary item like this:
```python

{
  address: "1234 Main Street",
  city: "Cochise",
  state: "AZ",
  zip: 12345,
  asking_price: 90000,
  acreage: 37.54
}
```

It may be a good idea to represent the list of plots as a _list of dictionaries_.

To calculate the price per acre, you may have to create a custom function.

You can just print your sorted lists to the console. Also, when you do print your lists, could you be sure that there is a dictionary property that contains the price per acre?
